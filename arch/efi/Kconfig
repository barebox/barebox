	  32-bit support currently does not compile and is not tested

	  Say yes here to register the first serial port on ioport 0x3f8.
	  This is useful to control barebox over a serial port if the board
	  has one. Enabling this option may not work on boards which do not
	  have a serial port. Also enable DRIVER_SERIAL_NS16550 to enable
	  the NS16550 driver.

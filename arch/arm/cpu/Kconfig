	  The ARM920T is licensed to be produced by numerous vendors,
	  and is used in the Maverick EP9312 and the Samsung S3C2410.

	  More information on the Maverick EP9312 at
	  <http://www.cirrus.com/en/products/ep9312.html>.

	  This is a variant of the ARM920. It has slightly different
	  instruction sequences for cache and TLB operations. Curiously,
	  there is no documentation on it at the ARM corporate website.

	  Say Y if you want support for the ARM926T processor.
	  Otherwise, say N.

	  ARM946E-S is a member of the ARM9E-S family of high-
	  performance, 32-bit system-on-chip processor solutions.
	  The TCM and ARMv5TE 32-bit instruction set is supported.

	  Say Y if you want support for the ARM946E-S processor.
	  Otherwise, say N.

	help
	  Say Y if you plan on running a kernel in big-endian mode.
	  Note that your board must be properly built and your board
	  port must properly enable any big-endian related features
	  of your chipset/board/processor.

	help
	  Say Y here if you need to switch CPU endianness before running
	  Linux kernel, e.g. if you want big-endian Barebox to run
	  little-endian Linux.

	  Currently implemented only by "bootz" command.

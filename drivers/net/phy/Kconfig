	bool "Driver for Atheros AT803X PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently supports the AT8030, AT8031 and AT8035 PHYs.

config DAVICOM_PHY
	bool "Driver for Davicom PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently supports dm9161e and dm9131

config DP83867_PHY
	tristate "Texas Instruments DP83867 Gigabit PHY"
	---help---
	  Currently supports the DP83867 PHY.

config LXT_PHY
	bool "Driver for the Intel LXT PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently supports the lxt971 PHY.

config MARVELL_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for Marvell PHYs"
	---help---
	  Add support for various Marvell PHYs (e.g. 88E1121R).

config MICREL_PHY
	bool "Driver for Micrel PHYs"
	---help---
	  Supports the KSZ9021, VSC8201, KS8001 PHYs.

config NATIONAL_PHY
	bool "Driver for National Semiconductor PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently supports the DP83865 PHY.

config SMSC_PHY
	bool "Drivers for SMSC PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently supports the LAN83C185, LAN8187 and LAN8700 PHYs

config NET_DSA_MV88E6XXX
	tristate "Marvell 88E6xxx Ethernet switch fabric support"

comment "MII bus device drivers"

config MDIO_MVEBU
	bool "Driver for MVEBU SoC MDIO bus"
	depends on ARCH_MVEBU
	---help---
	  Driver for the MDIO bus found on Marvell EBU SoCs.

config MDIO_BITBANG
        bool "Support for bitbanged MDIO buses"
	---help---
          This module implements the MDIO bus protocol in software,
          for use by low level drivers that export the ability to
          drive the relevant pins.

          If in doubt, say N.

config MDIO_GPIO
	bool "Support for GPIO lib-based bitbanged MDIO buses"
	depends on MDIO_BITBANG && GPIOLIB
	---help---
	  Supports GPIO lib-based MDIO busses.

config MDIO_BUS_MUX
	bool
	help
	  This module provides a driver framework for MDIO bus
	  multiplexers which connect one of several child MDIO busses
	  to a parent bus.  Switching between child busses is done by
	  device specific drivers.

config MDIO_BUS_MUX_GPIO
	bool "GPIO controlled MDIO bus multiplexers"
	depends on OF_GPIO
	select MDIO_BUS_MUX
	help
	  This module provides a driver for MDIO bus multiplexers that
	  are controlled via GPIO lines.  The multiplexer connects one of
	  several child MDIO busses to a parent bus.  Child bus
	  selection is under the control of GPIO lines.

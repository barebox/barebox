	  ARM System Control and Management Interface (SCMI) protocol is a
	  set of operating system-independent software interfaces that are
	  used in system management. SCMI is extensible and currently provides
	  interfaces for: Discovery and self-description of the interfaces
	  it supports, Power domain management which is the ability to place
	  a given device or domain into the various power-saving states that
	  it supports, Performance management which is the ability to control
	  the performance of a domain that is composed of compute engines
	  such as application processors and other accelerators, Clock
	  management which is the ability to set and inquire rates on platform
	  managed clocks and Sensor management which is the ability to read
	  sensor data.

	  This protocol library provides interface for all the client drivers
	  making use of the features offered by the SCMI.

config ARM_SCMI_HAVE_TRANSPORT
	bool
	help
	  This declares whether at least one SCMI transport has been configured.
	  Used to trigger a build bug when trying to build SCMI without any
	  configured transport.

config ARM_SCMI_HAVE_SHMEM
	bool
	help
	  This declares whether a shared memory based transport for SCMI is
	  available.

config ARM_SCMI_HAVE_MSG
	bool
	help
	  This declares whether a message passing based transport for SCMI is
	  available.

	  This enables the OP-TEE service based transport for SCMI.

	  If you want the ARM SCMI PROTOCOL stack to include support for a
	  transport based on OP-TEE SCMI service, answer Y.

	  Enable SMC based transport for SCMI.

	  If you want the ARM SCMI PROTOCOL stack to include support for a
	  transport based on SMC, answer Y.

	  This enables support for the SCMI power domains which can be

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called scmi_pm_domain. Note this may needed early in boot
	  before rootfs may be available.

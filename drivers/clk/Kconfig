	  The <linux/clk.h> calls support software clock gating and

	bool
	help
	  Select this option when the clock API in <linux/clk.h> is implemented
	  by platform/architecture code. This method is deprecated. Modern
	  code should select COMMON_CLK instead and not define a custom
	  'struct clk'.

	help
	  The common clock framework is a single definition of struct
	  clk, useful across many platforms, as well as an
	  implementation of the clock API in include/linux/clk.h.
	  Architectures utilizing the common struct clk should select
	  this option.

	  This driver provides support for clocks that are controlled

	  This driver uses SCMI Message Protocol to interact with the
	  firmware providing all the clock controls.

	  Otherwise, say N.

	  Choose this if the MCI framework should always probe for all attached
	  MCI cards on system start up. This may required for some legacy boards.
	  When this is 'n', probing happens on demand either with "mci*.probe=1"
	  or with driver/board code calling device_detect.

	  Provide access to the 'boot partitions' of devices of type 'MMC'.
	  These so called 'hardware partitions' act like an independent memory

	  Provide access to the 'general purpose partitions' of devices of type

	  memory device and thus, need special handling.

	  Note: only 'MMC' devices have 'general purpose partitions'. So, if
	  you don't use an 'MMC' device, you don't need this support.

	  Note: by default, 'MMC' devices have no 'general purpose partitions',
	  it requires a special one-time configuration step to enable them.

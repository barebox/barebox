	  A barebox build should not cause any compiler warnings, and this
	  enables the '-Werror' flags to enforce that rule by default.

	  However, if you have a new (or very old) compiler with odd and
	  unusual warnings, or you have some architecture with problems,
	  you may need to disable this config option in order to
	  successfully build barebox.

	  If in doubt, say Y.

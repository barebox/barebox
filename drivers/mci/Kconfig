config MCI_STARTUP
	bool "Force probe on system start"
	help
	  Say 'y' here if the MCI framework should always probe for all attached
	  MCI cards on system start up. This may required for some legacy boards.
	  When this is 'n', probing happens on demand either with "mci*.probe=1"
	  or with driver/board code calling device_detect.

config MCI_INFO
	bool "MCI Info"

	default y
	help
	  This entry adds more info about the attached MCI card, when the
	  'devinfo' command is used on the mci device.

config MCI_MMC_BOOT_PARTITIONS
	bool "support MMC boot partitions"
	help
	  Provide access to the 'boot partitions' of devices of type 'MMC'.
	  These so called 'hardware partitions' act like an independent memory
	  device and thus, need special handling.

	  Note: only 'MMC' have 'boot partitions'. So, if you don't use an
	  'MMC' device, you don't need this support.

config MCI_MMC_GPP_PARTITIONS
	bool "support MMC general purpose partitions (GPP)"
	help
	  Provide access to the 'general purpose partitions' of devices of type
	  'MMC'. These so called 'hardware partitions' act like an independent
	  memory device and thus, need special handling.

	  Note: only 'MMC' devices have 'general purpose partitions'. So, if
	  you don't use an 'MMC' device, you don't need this support.

	  Note: by default, 'MMC' devices have no 'general purpose partitions',
	  it requires a special one-time configuration step to enable them.

	select CRC7
	depends on SPI
	help
	  Some systems access MMC/SD/SDIO cards using a SPI controller
	  instead of using a "native" MMC/SD/SDIO controller. This has a
	  disadvantage of being relatively high overhead, but a compensating
	  advantage of working on many systems without dedicated MMC/SD/SDIO
	  controllers.

	  In-tree Defconfigs that enable multiple boards with different firmware
	  binary requirements would say y here, so you don't need unrelated firmware
	  for the build to succeed.

	  Defconfigs custom-tailored to products would say n here as all boards
	  being built should be functional and have their firmware available.

	  If in doubt, say Y and refer to the documentation on where to acquire the
	  needed firmware.

	bool "verify next image to load"
	help
	  The boot process of some SoCs uses multiple stages where the first stage is
	  a stripped down barebox loaded by the SoC's ROM and the next state is a full
	  barebox loaded by the first stage. In a trusted boot scenario the next stage
	  has to be verified by the first stage,

	  This option allows to specify the next image to be loaded. Put the next stage
	  image to firmware/next-image.bin. The next-image.bin won't be added to the
	  barebox binary, but a sha256 hash of the image will be generated and compiled
	  into the first stage which can be used to verify the next stage.

	  Note that this option only enabled generation of the sha256 hash. Loading and
	  starting the next stage is highly SoC dependent and it's the SoC code's
	  responsibility to actually verify the hash and to only start successfully
	  verified images. The function to check the next stage image hash is
	  firmware_next_image_verify(), make sure your SoC code uses it.

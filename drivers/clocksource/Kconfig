	  When porting barebox to a new SoC there might be a case
	  of broken or absent clocksource. This causes barebox serial
	  console to be non functional.
	  To solve the problem barebox has built-in software-only clocksource.
	  The software-only clocksource is used only if no hardware clocksource
	  is registered. This can help if initialization order is wrong so that
	  the time functions are used before the real clocksource was initialized.
	      WARNING!!! Built-in software-only clocksource doesn't provide correct timing.
	  The option CONFIG_CLOCKSOURCE_DUMMY_RATE is used to adjust this clocksource.
	  The bigger rate valuest makes clocksource "faster".

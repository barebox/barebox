config MTD_NAND_VERIFY_WRITE
	bool "Verify NAND page writes"
	help
	  This adds an extra check when data is written to the flash. The
	  NAND flash device internally checks only bits transitioning
	  from 1 to 0. There is a rare possibility that even though the
	  device thinks the write was successful, a bit could have been
	  flipped accidentally due to device wear or something else.

config MTD_NAND_ECC_SMC

	help
	  Software ECC according to the Smart Media Specification.

	  Enable this option only when your board has first generation
	  NAND chips (page size 256 byte, erase size 4-8KiB). The IDs

	  The ARM920T is licensed to be produced by numerous vendors,
	  and is used in the Maverick EP9312 and the Samsung S3C2410.

	  More information on the Maverick EP9312 at
	  <http://www.cirrus.com/en/products/ep9312.html>.

	  Say Y if you want support for the ARM920T processor.
	  Otherwise, say N.

# ARM926T
config CPU_ARM926T
	bool
	select CPU_32v5
	help
	  This is a variant of the ARM920. It has slightly different
	  instruction sequences for cache and TLB operations. Curiously,
	  there is no documentation on it at the ARM corporate website.

	  Say Y if you want support for the ARM926T processor.
	  Otherwise, say N.

	  This is a Marvell implementation of an ARMv5TE compatible
	  ARM core, used in the Marvell Kirkwood SoC family.

config CPU_BIG_ENDIAN
	bool "Build big-endian kernel"
	depends on ARCH_SUPPORTS_BIG_ENDIAN
	help
	  Say Y if you plan on running a kernel in big-endian mode.
	  Note that your board must be properly built and your board
	  port must properly enable any big-endian related features
	  of your chipset/board/processor.

config BOOT_ENDIANNESS_SWITCH
	bool "Support switching of Linux kernel endianness"
	help
	  Say Y here if you need to switch CPU endianness before running
	  Linux kernel, e.g. if you want big-endian Barebox to run
	  little-endian Linux.

	  Currently implemented only by "bootz" command.

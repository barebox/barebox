/*
  A version of malloc/free/realloc written by Doug Lea and released to the
  public domain.  Send questions/comments/complaints/performance data
  to dl@cs.oswego.edu

* VERSION 2.6.6  Sun Mar  5 19:10:03 2000  Doug Lea  (dl at gee)

   Note: There may be an updated version of this malloc obtainable at
	   ftp://g.oswego.edu/pub/misc/malloc.c
	 Check before installing!

* Why use this malloc?

  This is not the fastest, most space-conserving, most portable, or
  most tunable malloc ever written. However it is among the fastest
  while also being among the most space-conserving, portable and tunable.
  Consistent balance across these factors results in a good general-purpose
  allocator. For a high-level description, see
     http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html

* Synopsis of public routines

  (Much fuller descriptions are contained in the program documentation below.)

  dlmalloc(size_t n);
     Return a pointer to a newly allocated chunk of at least n bytes, or null
     if no space is available.
  dlfree(Void_t* p);
     Release the chunk of memory pointed to by p, or no effect if p is null.
  dlrealloc(Void_t* p, size_t n);
     Return a pointer to a chunk of size n that contains the same data
     as does chunk p up to the minimum of (n, p's size) bytes, or null
     if no space is available. The returned pointer may or may not be
     the same as p. If p is null, equivalent to malloc.  Unless the
     #define REALLOC_ZERO_BYTES_FREES below is set, realloc with a
     size argument of zero (re)allocates a minimum-sized chunk.
  dlmemalign(size_t alignment, size_t n);
     Return a pointer to a newly allocated chunk of n bytes, aligned
     in accord with the alignment argument, which must be a power of
     two.
  dlcalloc(size_t unit, size_t quantity);
     Returns a pointer to quantity * unit bytes, with all locations
     set to zero.
  malloc_trim(size_t pad);
     Release all but pad bytes of freed top-most memory back
     to the system. Return 1 if successful, else 0.
  dlmalloc_usable_size(Void_t* p);
     Report the number usable allocated bytes associated with allocated
     chunk p. This may or may not report more bytes than were requested,
     due to alignment and minimum size constraints.
  malloc_stats();
     Prints brief summary statistics on stderr.
  mallinfo()
     Returns (by copy) a struct containing various summary statistics.
  mallopt(int parameter_number, int parameter_value)
     Changes one of the tunable parameters described below. Returns
     1 if successful in changing the parameter, else 0.

* Vital statistics:

  Alignment:                            8-byte
       8 byte alignment is currently hardwired into the design.  This
       seems to suffice for all current machines and C compilers.

  Assumed pointer representation:       4 or 8 bytes
       Code for 8-byte pointers is untested by me but has worked
       reliably by Wolfram Gloger, who contributed most of the
       changes supporting this.

  Assumed size_t  representation:       4 or 8 bytes
       Note that size_t is allowed to be 4 bytes even if pointers are 8.

  Minimum overhead per allocated chunk: 4 or 8 bytes
       Each malloced chunk has a hidden overhead of 4 bytes holding size
       and status information.

  Minimum allocated size: 4-byte ptrs:  16 bytes    (including 4 overhead)
			  8-byte ptrs:  24/32 bytes (including, 4/8 overhead)

       When a chunk is freed, 12 (for 4byte ptrs) or 20 (for 8 byte
       ptrs but 4 byte size) or 24 (for 8/8) additional bytes are
       needed; 4 (8) for a trailing size field
       and 8 (16) bytes for free list pointers. Thus, the minimum
       allocatable size is 16/24/32 bytes.

       Even a request for zero bytes (i.e., malloc(0)) returns a
       pointer to something of the minimum allocatable size.

  Maximum allocated size: 4-byte size_t: 2^31 -  8 bytes
			  8-byte size_t: 2^63 - 16 bytes

       It is assumed that (possibly signed) size_t bit values suffice to
       represent chunk sizes. `Possibly signed' is due to the fact
       that `size_t' may be defined on a system as either a signed or
       an unsigned type. To be conservative, values that would appear
       as negative numbers are avoided.
       Requests for sizes with a negative sign bit when the request
       size is treaded as a long will return null.

  Maximum overhead wastage per allocated chunk: normally 15 bytes

       Alignnment demands, plus the minimum allocatable size restriction
       make the normal worst-case wastage 15 bytes (i.e., up to 15
       more bytes will be allocated than were requested in malloc), with
       two exceptions:
	 1. Because requests for zero bytes allocate non-zero space,
	    the worst case wastage for a request of zero bytes is 24 bytes.
	 2. For requests >= mmap_threshold that are serviced via
	    mmap(), the worst case wastage is 8 bytes plus the remainder
	    from a system page (the minimal mmap unit); typically 4096 bytes.

* Limitations

    Here are some features that are NOT currently supported

    * No user-definable hooks for callbacks and the like.
    * No automated mechanism for fully checking that all accesses
      to malloced memory stay within their bounds.
    * No support for compaction.

* Synopsis of compile-time options:

    People have reported using previous versions of this malloc on all
    versions of Unix, sometimes by tweaking some of the defines
    below. It has been tested most extensively on Solaris and
    Linux. It is also reported to work on WIN32 platforms.
    People have also reported adapting this malloc for use in
    stand-alone embedded systems.

    The implementation is in straight, hand-tuned ANSI C.  Among other
    consequences, it uses a lot of macros.  Because of this, to be at
    all usable, this code should be compiled using an optimizing compiler
    (for example gcc -O2) that can simplify expressions and control
    paths.

  __STD_C                  (default: derived from C compiler defines)
     Nonzero if using ANSI-standard C compiler, a C++ compiler, or
     a C compiler sufficiently close to ANSI to get away with it.
  DEBUG                    (default: NOT defined)
     Define to enable debugging. Adds fairly extensive assertion-based
     checking to help track down memory errors, but noticeably slows down
     execution.
  REALLOC_ZERO_BYTES_FREES (default: NOT defined)
     Define this if you think that realloc(p, 0) should be equivalent
     to free(p). Otherwise, since malloc returns a unique pointer for
     malloc(0), so does realloc(p, 0).
  HAVE_MEMCPY               (default: defined)
     Define if you are not otherwise using ANSI STD C, but still
     have memcpy and memset in your C library and want to use them.
     Otherwise, simple internal versions are supplied.
  USE_MEMCPY               (default: 1 if HAVE_MEMCPY is defined, 0 otherwise)
     Define as 1 if you want the C library versions of memset and
     memcpy called in realloc and calloc (otherwise macro versions are used).
     At least on some platforms, the simple macro versions usually
     outperform libc versions.
  HAVE_MMAP                 (default: defined as 1)
     Define to non-zero to optionally make malloc() use mmap() to
     allocate very large blocks.
  HAVE_MREMAP                 (default: defined as 0 unless Linux libc set)
     Define to non-zero to optionally make realloc() use mremap() to
     reallocate very large blocks.
  malloc_getpagesize        (default: derived from system #includes)
     Either a constant or routine call returning the system page size.
  HAVE_USR_INCLUDE_MALLOC_H (default: NOT defined)
     Optionally define if you are on a system with a /usr/include/malloc.h
     that declares struct mallinfo. It is not at all necessary to
     define this even if you do, but will ensure consistency.
  INTERNAL_SIZE_T           (default: size_t)
     Define to a 32-bit type (probably `unsigned int') if you are on a
     64-bit machine, yet do not want or need to allow malloc requests of
     greater than 2^31 to be handled. This saves space, especially for
     very small chunks.
  INTERNAL_LINUX_C_LIB      (default: NOT defined)
     Defined only when compiled as part of Linux libc.
     Also note that there is some odd internal name-mangling via defines
     (for example, internally, `malloc' is named `mALLOc') needed
     when compiling in this case. These look funny but don't otherwise
     affect anything.
  WIN32                     (default: undefined)
     Define this on MS win (95, nt) platforms to compile in sbrk emulation.
  LACKS_UNISTD_H            (default: undefined if not WIN32)
     Define this if your system does not have a <unistd.h>.
  LACKS_SYS_PARAM_H         (default: undefined if not WIN32)
     Define this if your system does not have a <sys/param.h>.
  MORECORE                  (default: sbrk)
     The name of the routine to call to obtain more memory from the system.
  NULL          (default: -1)
     The value returned upon failure of MORECORE.
  MORECORE_CLEARS           (default 1)
     True (1) if the routine mapped to MORECORE zeroes out memory (which
     holds for sbrk).
  DEFAULT_TRIM_THRESHOLD
  DEFAULT_TOP_PAD
  DEFAULT_MMAP_THRESHOLD
  DEFAULT_MMAP_MAX
     Default values of tunable parameters (described in detail below)
     controlling interaction with host system routines (sbrk, mmap, etc).
     These values may also be changed dynamically via mallopt(). The
     preset defaults are those that give best performance for typical
     programs/systems.
  USE_DL_PREFIX             (default: undefined)
     Prefix all public routines with the string 'dl'.  Useful to
     quickly avoid procedure declaration conflicts and linker symbol
     conflicts with existing memory allocation routines.

#ifndef DEFAULT_TRIM_THRESHOLD
#define DEFAULT_TRIM_THRESHOLD (128 * 1024)
#endif

/*
    M_TRIM_THRESHOLD is the maximum amount of unused top-most memory
      to keep before releasing via malloc_trim in free().

      Automatic trimming is mainly useful in long-lived programs.
      Because trimming via sbrk can be slow on some systems, and can
      sometimes be wasteful (in cases where programs immediately
      afterward allocate more large chunks) the value should be high
      enough so that your overall system performance would improve by
      releasing.

      The trim threshold and the mmap control parameters (see below)
      can be traded off with one another. Trimming and mmapping are
      two different ways of releasing unused memory back to the
      system. Between these two, it is often possible to keep
      system-level demands of a long-lived program down to a bare
      minimum. For example, in one test suite of sessions measuring
      the XF86 X server on Linux, using a trim threshold of 128K and a
      mmap threshold of 192K led to near-minimal long term resource
      consumption.

      If you are using this malloc in a long-lived program, it should
      pay to experiment with these values.  As a rough guide, you
      might set to a value close to the average size of a process
      (program) running on your system.  Releasing this much memory
      would allow such a process to run in memory.  Generally, it's
      worth it to tune for trimming rather tham memory mapping when a
      program undergoes phases where several large chunks are
      allocated and released in ways that can reuse each other's
      storage, perhaps mixed with phases where there are no such
      chunks at all.  And in well-behaved long-lived programs,
      controlling release of large blocks via trimming versus mapping
      is usually faster.

      However, in most programs, these parameters serve mainly as
      protection against the system-level effects of carrying around
      massive amounts of unneeded memory. Since frequent calls to
      sbrk, mmap, and munmap otherwise degrade performance, the default
      parameters are set to relatively high values that serve only as
      safeguards.

      The default trim value is high enough to cause trimming only in
      fairly extreme (by current memory consumption standards) cases.
      It must be greater than page size to have any useful effect.  To
      disable trimming completely, you can set to (unsigned long)(-1);


*/

#ifndef DEFAULT_TOP_PAD
#define DEFAULT_TOP_PAD        (0)
#endif

/*
    M_TOP_PAD is the amount of extra `padding' space to allocate or
      retain whenever sbrk is called. It is used in two ways internally:

      * When sbrk is called to extend the top of the arena to satisfy
	a new malloc request, this much padding is added to the sbrk
	request.

      * When malloc_trim is called automatically from free(),
	it is used as the `pad' argument.

      In both cases, the actual amount of padding is rounded
      so that the end of the arena is always a system page boundary.

      The main reason for using padding is to avoid calling sbrk so
      often. Having even a small pad greatly reduces the likelihood
      that nearly every malloc request during program start-up (or
      after trimming) will invoke sbrk, which needlessly wastes
      time.

      Automatic rounding-up to page-size units is normally sufficient
      to avoid measurable overhead, so the default is 0.  However, in
      systems where sbrk is relatively slow, it can pay to increase
      this value, at the expense of carrying around more memory than
      the program needs.

*/

#ifndef DEFAULT_MMAP_THRESHOLD
#define DEFAULT_MMAP_THRESHOLD (128 * 1024)
#endif

/*

    M_MMAP_THRESHOLD is the request size threshold for using mmap()
      to service a request. Requests of at least this size that cannot
      be allocated using already-existing space will be serviced via mmap.
      (If enough normal freed space already exists it is used instead.)

      Using mmap segregates relatively large chunks of memory so that
      they can be individually obtained and released from the host
      system. A request serviced through mmap is never reused by any
      other request (at least not directly; the system may just so
      happen to remap successive requests to the same locations).

      Segregating space in this way has the benefit that mmapped space
      can ALWAYS be individually released back to the system, which
      helps keep the system level memory demands of a long-lived
      program low. Mapped memory can never become `locked' between
      other chunks, as can happen with normally allocated chunks, which
      means that even trimming via malloc_trim would not release them.

      However, it has the disadvantages that:

	 1. The space cannot be reclaimed, consolidated, and then
	    used to service later requests, as happens with normal chunks.
	 2. It can lead to more wastage because of mmap page alignment
	    requirements
	 3. It causes malloc performance to be more dependent on host
	    system memory management support routines which may vary in
	    implementation quality and may impose arbitrary
	    limitations. Generally, servicing a request via normal
	    malloc steps is faster than going through a system's mmap.

      All together, these considerations should lead you to use mmap
      only for relatively large requests.

#define DEFAULT_MMAP_MAX       (0)

/*
    M_MMAP_MAX is the maximum number of requests to simultaneously
      service using mmap. This parameter exists because:

	 1. Some systems have a limited number of internal tables for
	    use by mmap.
	 2. In most systems, overreliance on mmap can degrade overall
	    performance.
	 3. If a program allocates many large regions, it is probably
	    better off using normal sbrk-based allocation routines that
	    can reclaim and reallocate normal heap memory. Using a
	    small value allows transition into this mode after the
	    first few allocations.

      Setting to 0 disables all use of mmap.  If HAVE_MMAP is not set,
      the default value is 0, and attempts to set it to non-zero values
      in mallopt will fail.

  This version of malloc supports the standard SVID/XPG mallinfo

   malloc_chunk details:

    (The following includes lightly edited explanations by Colin Plumb.)

    Chunks of memory are maintained using a `boundary tag' method as
    described in e.g., Knuth or Standish.  (See the paper by Paul
    Wilson ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/allocsrv.ps for a
    survey of such techniques.)  Sizes of free chunks are stored both
    in the front of each chunk and at the end.  This makes
    consolidating fragmented chunks into bigger chunks very fast.  The
    size fields also hold bits representing whether chunks are free or
    in use.

    An allocated chunk looks like this:


    chunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
	    |             Size of previous chunk, if allocated            | |
	    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
	    |             Size of chunk, in bytes                         |P|
      mem-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
	    |             User data starts here...                          .
	    .                                                               .
	    .             (malloc_usable_space() bytes)                     .
	    .                                                               |
nextchunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
	    |             Size of chunk                                     |
	    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


    Where "chunk" is the front of the chunk for the purpose of most of
    the malloc code, but "mem" is the pointer that is returned to the
    user.  "Nextchunk" is the beginning of the next contiguous chunk.

    Chunks always begin on even word boundaries, so the mem portion
    (which is returned to the user) is also on an even word boundary, and
    thus double-word aligned.

    Free chunks are stored in circular doubly-linked lists, and look like this:

    chunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
	    |             Size of previous chunk                            |
	    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    `head:' |             Size of chunk, in bytes                         |P|
      mem-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
	    |             Forward pointer to next chunk in list             |
	    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
	    |             Back pointer to previous chunk in list            |
	    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
	    |             Unused space (may be 0 bytes long)                .
	    .                                                               .
	    .                                                               |
nextchunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    `foot:' |             Size of chunk, in bytes                           |
	    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    The P (PREV_INUSE) bit, stored in the unused low-order bit of the
    chunk size (which is always a multiple of two words), is an in-use
    bit for the *previous* chunk.  If that bit is *clear*, then the
    word before the current chunk size contains the previous chunk
    size, and can be used to find the front of the previous chunk.
    (The very first chunk allocated always has this bit set,
    preventing access to non-existent (or non-owned) memory.)

    Note that the `foot' of the current chunk is actually represented
    as the prev_size of the NEXT chunk. (This makes it easier to
    deal with alignments etc).

    The two exceptions to all this are

     1. The special chunk `top', which doesn't bother using the
	trailing size field since there is no
	next contiguous chunk that would have to index off it. (After
	initialization, `top' is forced to always exist.  If it would
	become less than MINSIZE bytes long, it is replenished via
	malloc_extend_top.)

     2. Chunks allocated via mmap, which have the second-lowest-order
	bit (IS_MMAPPED) set in their size fields.  Because they are
	never merged or traversed from any other chunk, they have no
	foot size or inuse information.

    Available chunks are kept in any of several places (all declared below):

    * `av': An array of chunks serving as bin headers for consolidated
       chunks. Each bin is doubly linked.  The bins are approximately
       proportionally (log) spaced.  There are a lot of these bins
       (128). This may look excessive, but works very well in
       practice.  All procedures maintain the invariant that no
       consolidated chunk physically borders another one. Chunks in
       bins are kept in size order, with ties going to the
       approximately least recently used chunk.

       The chunks in each bin are maintained in decreasing sorted order by
       size.  This is irrelevant for the small bins, which all contain
       the same-sized chunks, but facilitates best-fit allocation for
       larger chunks. (These lists are just sequential. Keeping them in
       order almost never requires enough traversal to warrant using
       fancier ordered data structures.)  Chunks of the same size are
       linked with the most recently freed at the front, and allocations
       are taken from the back.  This results in LRU or FIFO allocation
       order, which tends to give each chunk an equal opportunity to be
       consolidated with adjacent freed chunks, resulting in larger free
       chunks and less fragmentation.

    * `top': The top-most available chunk (i.e., the one bordering the
       end of available memory) is treated specially. It is never
       included in any bin, is used only if no other chunk is
       available, and is released back to the system if it is very
       large (see M_TRIM_THRESHOLD).

    * `last_remainder': A bin holding only the remainder of the
       most recently split (non-top) chunk. This bin is checked
       before other non-fitting chunks, so as to provide better
       locality for runs of sequentially allocated chunks.

    *  Implicitly, through the host system's memory mapping tables.
       If supported, requests greater than a threshold are usually
       serviced via calls to mmap, and then later released via munmap.

   Bins

    The bins, `av_' are an array of pairs of pointers serving as the
    heads of (initially empty) doubly-linked lists of chunks, laid out
    in a way so that each pair can be treated as if it were in a
    malloc_chunk. (This way, the fd/bk offsets for linking bin heads
    and chunks are the same).

    Bins for sizes < 512 bytes contain chunks of all the same size, spaced
    8 bytes apart. Larger bins are approximately logarithmically
    spaced. (See the table below.) The `av_' array is never mentioned
    directly in the code, but instead via bin access macros.

    Bin layout:

    64 bins of size       8
    32 bins of size      64
    16 bins of size     512
     8 bins of size    4096
     4 bins of size   32768
     2 bins of size  262144
     1 bin  of size what's left

    There is actually a little bit of slop in the numbers in bin_index
    for the sake of speed. This makes no difference elsewhere.

    The special chunks `top' and `last_remainder' get their own bins,
    (this is implemented via yet more trickery with the av_ array),
    although `top' is never properly linked to its bin since it is
    always handled specially.

/*
  Malloc Algorithm:

    The requested size is first converted into a usable form, `nb'.
    This currently means to add 4 bytes overhead plus possibly more to
    obtain 8-byte alignment and/or to obtain a size of at least
    MINSIZE (currently 16 bytes), the smallest allocatable size.
    (All fits are considered `exact' if they are within MINSIZE bytes.)

    From there, the first successful of the following steps is taken:

      1. The bin corresponding to the request size is scanned, and if
	 a chunk of exactly the right size is found, it is taken.

      2. The most recently remaindered chunk is used if it is big
	 enough.  This is a form of (roving) first fit, used only in
	 the absence of exact fits. Runs of consecutive requests use
	 the remainder of the chunk used for the previous such request
	 whenever possible. This limited use of a first-fit style
	 allocation strategy tends to give contiguous chunks
	 coextensive lifetimes, which improves locality and can reduce
	 fragmentation in the long run.

      3. Other bins are scanned in increasing size order, using a
	 chunk big enough to fulfill the request, and splitting off
	 any remainder.  This search is strictly by best-fit; i.e.,
	 the smallest (with ties going to approximately the least
	 recently used) chunk that fits is selected.

      4. If large enough, the chunk bordering the end of memory
	 (`top') is split off. (This use of `top' is in accord with
	 the best-fit search rule.  In effect, `top' is treated as
	 larger (and thus less well fitting) than any other available
	 chunk since it can be extended to be as large as necessary
	 (up to system limitations).

      5. If the request size meets the mmap threshold and the
	 system supports mmap, and there are few enough currently
	 allocated mmapped regions, and a call to mmap succeeds,
	 the request is allocated via direct memory mapping.

      6. Otherwise, the top of memory is extended by
	 obtaining more space from the system (normally using sbrk,
	 but definable to anything else via the MORECORE macro).
	 Memory is gathered from the system (in system page-sized
	 units) in a way that allows chunks obtained across different
	 sbrk calls to be consolidated, but does not require
	 contiguous memory. Thus, it should be safe to intersperse
	 mallocs with other sbrk calls.


      All allocations are made from the the `lowest' part of any found
      chunk. (The implementation invariant is that prev_inuse is
      always true of any allocated chunk; i.e., that each allocated
      chunk borders either a previously allocated and still in-use chunk,
      or the base of its memory arena.)

  Realloc algorithm:

    Chunks that were obtained via mmap cannot be extended or shrunk
    unless HAVE_MREMAP is defined, in which case mremap is used.
    Otherwise, if their reallocation is for additional space, they are
    copied.  If for less, they are just left alone.

    Otherwise, if the reallocation is for additional space, and the
    chunk can be extended, it is, else a malloc-copy-free sequence is
    taken.  There are several different ways that a chunk could be
    extended. All are tried:

       * Extending forward into following adjacent free chunk.
       * Shifting backwards, joining preceding adjacent space
       * Both shifting backwards and extending forward.
       * Extending into newly sbrked space

    Unless the #define REALLOC_ZERO_BYTES_FREES is set, realloc with a
    size argument of zero (re)allocates a minimum-sized chunk.

    If the reallocation is for less space, and the new request is for
    a `small' (<512 bytes) size, then the newly unused space is lopped
    off and freed.

    The old unix realloc convention of allowing the last-free'd chunk
    to be used as an argument to realloc is no longer supported.
    I don't know of any programs still relying on this feature,
    and allowing it would also allow too many other incorrect
    usages of realloc to be sensible.

History:

    V2.6.6 Sun Dec  5 07:42:19 1999  Doug Lea  (dl at gee)
      * return null for negative arguments
      * Added Several WIN32 cleanups from Martin C. Fong <mcfong@yahoo.com>
	 * Add 'LACKS_SYS_PARAM_H' for those systems without 'sys/param.h'
	  (e.g. WIN32 platforms)
	 * Cleanup up header file inclusion for WIN32 platforms
	 * Cleanup code to avoid Microsoft Visual C++ compiler complaints
	 * Add 'USE_DL_PREFIX' to quickly allow co-existence with existing
	   memory allocation routines
	 * Set 'malloc_getpagesize' for WIN32 platforms (needs more work)
	 * Use 'assert' rather than 'ASSERT' in WIN32 code to conform to
	   usage of 'assert' in non-WIN32 code
	 * Improve WIN32 'sbrk()' emulation's 'findRegion()' routine to
	   avoid infinite loop
      * Always call 'fREe()' rather than 'free()'

    V2.6.5 Wed Jun 17 15:57:31 1998  Doug Lea  (dl at gee)
      * Fixed ordering problem with boundary-stamping

    V2.6.3 Sun May 19 08:17:58 1996  Doug Lea  (dl at gee)
      * Added pvalloc, as recommended by H.J. Liu
      * Added 64bit pointer support mainly from Wolfram Gloger
      * Added anonymously donated WIN32 sbrk emulation
      * Malloc, calloc, getpagesize: add optimizations from Raymond Nijssen
      * malloc_extend_top: fix mask error that caused wastage after
	foreign sbrks
      * Add linux mremap support code from HJ Liu

    V2.6.2 Tue Dec  5 06:52:55 1995  Doug Lea  (dl at gee)
      * Integrated most documentation with the code.
      * Add support for mmap, with help from
	Wolfram Gloger (Gloger@lrz.uni-muenchen.de).
      * Use last_remainder in more cases.
      * Pack bins using idea from  colin@nyx10.cs.du.edu
      * Use ordered bins instead of best-fit threshold
      * Eliminate block-local decls to simplify tracing and debugging.
      * Support another case of realloc via move into top
      * Fix error occurring when initial sbrk_base not word-aligned.
      * Rely on page size for units instead of SBRK_UNIT to
	avoid surprises about sbrk alignment conventions.
      * Add mallinfo, mallopt. Thanks to Raymond Nijssen
	(raymond@es.ele.tue.nl) for the suggestion.
      * Add `pad' argument to malloc_trim and top_pad mallopt parameter.
      * More precautions for cases where other routines call sbrk,
	courtesy of Wolfram Gloger (Gloger@lrz.uni-muenchen.de).
      * Added macros etc., allowing use in linux libc from
	H.J. Lu (hjl@gnu.ai.mit.edu)
      * Inverted this history list

    V2.6.1 Sat Dec  2 14:10:57 1995  Doug Lea  (dl at gee)
      * Re-tuned and fixed to behave more nicely with V2.6.0 changes.
      * Removed all preallocation code since under current scheme
	the work required to undo bad preallocations exceeds
	the work saved in good cases for most test programs.
      * No longer use return list or unconsolidated bins since
	no scheme using them consistently outperforms those that don't
	given above changes.
      * Use best fit for very large chunks to prevent some worst-cases.
      * Added some support for debugging

    V2.6.0 Sat Nov  4 07:05:23 1995  Doug Lea  (dl at gee)
      * Removed footers when chunks are in use. Thanks to
	Paul Wilson (wilson@cs.texas.edu) for the suggestion.

    V2.5.4 Wed Nov  1 07:54:51 1995  Doug Lea  (dl at gee)
      * Added malloc_trim, with help from Wolfram Gloger
	(wmglo@Dent.MED.Uni-Muenchen.DE).

    V2.5.3 Tue Apr 26 10:16:01 1994  Doug Lea  (dl at g)

    V2.5.2 Tue Apr  5 16:20:40 1994  Doug Lea  (dl at g)
      * realloc: try to expand in both directions
      * malloc: swap order of clean-bin strategy;
      * realloc: only conditionally expand backwards
      * Try not to scavenge used bins
      * Use bin counts as a guide to preallocation
      * Occasionally bin return list chunks in first scan
      * Add a few optimizations from colin@nyx10.cs.du.edu

    V2.5.1 Sat Aug 14 15:40:43 1993  Doug Lea  (dl at g)
      * faster bin computation & slightly different binning
      * merged all consolidations to one part of malloc proper
	 (eliminating old malloc_find_space & malloc_clean_bin)
      * Scan 2 returns chunks (not just 1)
      * Propagate failure in realloc if malloc returns 0
      * Add stuff to allow compilation on non-ANSI compilers
	  from kpv@research.att.com

    V2.5 Sat Aug  7 07:41:59 1993  Doug Lea  (dl at g.oswego.edu)
      * removed potential for odd address access in prev_chunk
      * removed dependency on getpagesize.h
      * misc cosmetics and a bit more internal documentation
      * anticosmetics: mangled names in macros to evade debugger strangeness
      * tested on sparc, hp-700, dec-mips, rs6000
	  with gcc & native cc (hp, dec only) allowing
	  Detlefs & Zorn comparison study (in SIGPLAN Notices.)

    Trial version Fri Aug 28 13:14:29 1992  Doug Lea  (dl at g.oswego.edu)
      * Based loosely on libg++-1.2X malloc. (It retains some of the overall
	 structure of old version,  but most details differ.)

barebox environment
===================

This driver provides an environment for barebox from the devicetree.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "barebox,environment"
- device-path: path to the environment

The device-path is a multistring property. The first string should be a
nodepath to the node containing the physical device of the environment.
The subsequent strings are of the form <type>:<options> to further describe
the path to the environment. Supported values for <type>:

partname:<partname>  This describes a partition on a device. <partname> can
                     be the label for mtd partitions, the number for DOS
		     partitions (beginning with 0) or the name for GPT
		     partitions

Example:

environment@0 {
	compatible = "barebox,environment";
	device-path = &flash, "partname:barebox-environment";
};

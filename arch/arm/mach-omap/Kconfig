config ARCH_OMAP3
	bool
	select CPU_V7
	select GENERIC_GPIO
	select CLOCKSOURCE_TI_32K
	help
	  Say Y here if you are using Texas Instrument's OMAP343x based platform

config ARCH_OMAP4
	bool
	select CPU_V7
	select GENERIC_GPIO
	select CLOCKSOURCE_TI_32K
	help
	  Say Y here if you are using Texas Instrument's OMAP4 based platform

config ARCH_AM33XX
	bool
	select CPU_V7
	select GENERIC_GPIO
	select CLOCKSOURCE_TI_DM
	select ARM_USE_COMPRESSED_DTB
	help
	  Say Y here if you are using Texas Instrument's AM33xx based platform

config ARCH_AM35XX
	bool
	select ARCH_OMAP3
	help
	  Say Y here if you are using Texas Instrument's AM35XX based platform

config OMAP_GPMC
	prompt "Support for GPMC configuration"
	bool
	default y
	help
	  Enable this if you use Texas Instrument's General purpose Memory
	  Controller(GPMC). GPMC allows you to configure devices such as NOR,
	  NAND, OneNAND etc.

config OMAP_BUILD_IFT
	prompt "build ift binary (MLO)"
	bool
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to build an MLO binary. On TI SoCs, this
	  binary is loaded to SRAM. It is responsible for initializing
	  the SDRAM and possibly chainloading a full-featured barebox.

config OMAP_BUILD_SPI
	prompt "build SPI binary"
	bool
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to build an barebox.spi image as used
	  on the AM35xx chips when booting from SPI NOR flash.

config BAREBOX_UPDATE_AM33XX_SPI_NOR_MLO
	prompt "barebox update SPI NOR MLO handler"
	bool
	depends on BAREBOX_UPDATE
	help
	  Say Y for barebox update SPI NOR MLO handler.
	  AM35xx, AM33xx chips use big endian MLO for SPI NOR flash.

config BAREBOX_UPDATE_AM33XX_NAND
	prompt "barebox update NAND handler"
	bool
	depends on BAREBOX_UPDATE
	help
	  Say Y for barebox update NAND handler. This update handler updates
	  4 default NAND xload slots with a single command.
	  The Handler also checks if the given image has a valid CH header.
	  This also includes a handler for updating the regular barebox binary
	  in NAND.

config BAREBOX_UPDATE_AM33XX_EMMC
	prompt "barebox update eMMC handler"
	bool
	depends on BAREBOX_UPDATE
	help
	  Say Y for barebox update eMMC handler.

config AM33XX_NET_BOOT
	bool "enable AM335x network boot"
	select ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES
	select NET_DHCP
	select FS_RAMFS
	select FS_TFTP
	select DRIVER_NET_CPSW
	default n
	depends on ARCH_AM33XX && NET

config OMAP4_USBBOOT
	bool "enable booting from USB"
	default n
	depends on ARCH_OMAP4 && !MMU
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to be able to boot an OMAP4 cpu from USB.
	  You need the utility program omap4_usbboot to boot from USB.
	  Please read omap4_usb_booting.txt for more information.

config OMAP3_USBBOOT
	bool "enable booting from USB"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP3
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to be able to boot the 2nd stage via USB. This
	  works by transferring the 2nd stage image using the MUSB controller
	  which is already initialized by the ROM code. Use the omap3-usb-loader
	  tool selectable below to upload images.

config OMAP_SERIALBOOT
	bool "enable booting from serial"
	select XYMODEM
	select FS_RAMFS
	depends on ARCH_AM33XX && SHELL_NONE
	depends on !CONSOLE_NONE
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to load the 2nd stage barebox.bin with
	  xmodem after booting from serial line.

config MACH_AFI_GF
	bool "af inventions GF"
	select ARCH_AM33XX
	  help
	  Say Y here if you are using afis GF

config MACH_BEAGLE
	bool "Texas Instrument's Beagle Board"
	select ARCH_OMAP3
	help
	  Say Y here if you are using Beagle Board

config MACH_BEAGLEBONE
	bool "Texas Instrument's Beagle Bone"
	select ARCH_AM33XX
	help
	  Say Y here if you are using Beagle Bone

config MACH_MYIRTECH_X335X
	bool "MYIR Tech Limited SOMs"

	bool "Phytec AM335X SOMs"
	select ARCH_AM33XX
	help
	  Say Y here if you are using a am335x based Phytecs SOM

config MACH_VSCOM_BALTOS
	bool "VScom Baltos Devices"
	select ARCH_AM33XX
	help
	  Say Y here if you are using a am335x based VScom Baltos devices

config MACH_WAGO_PFC_AM35XX
        bool "Wago PFC200 Fieldbus Controller"
        select ARCH_AM35XX
        help
          Say Y here if you are using a the AM3505 based PFC200 controller

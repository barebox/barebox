	  Compute a persistent machine-specific id and store it to $global.machine_id.

	  machine_id_set_hashable(). If multiple sources are available, the
	  information provided by the last call prior to the late initcall
	  set_machine_id() is used to generate the machine id from. Thus when
	  updating barebox the machine id might change.

	  global.bootm.provide_machine_id may be used to automatically set
	  the linux.bootargs.machine_id global variable with a value of
	  systemd.machine_id=${global.machine_id}

	  Note: if no hashable information is available no machine id will be passed
	  to the kernel.

	  List of dts fragment files that will be appended to Barebox's device
	  tree(s) source when building the dtb file(s).  If multiple files are
	  listed, they will be appended in order.  Relative filenames will use
	  the dtc include search path.

	  A preprocessor macro based on the name of the main dts will be
	  defined, which allows the dts fragments to be based on which image of
	  a multi image build they are being used in. Given the dts filename
	  used for a board is "foo-board.dts" the external dts usage can be
	  limited to that board with

	  #ifdef foo_board_dts
	  ...
	  #endif

	  It is not intended that this is put into Barebox' defconfig files.
	  Instead, it's an external build system's job, like Yocto or buildroot,
	  to add dts fragments from outside the Barebox source tree into the
	  Barebox build.

Release Migration Guides
========================

Each document in this chapter provides information about how to move to one
release of barebox from the previous one.

The goal is to help integrators and users of barebox to adapt their
configuration and downstream board support. barebox API breakage that
cause build errors are generally out-of-scope for these documents.

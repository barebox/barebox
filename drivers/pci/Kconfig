	  Find out whether you have a PCI motherboard. PCI is the name of a
	  bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff inside
	  your box. If you have PCI, say Y, otherwise N.

	depends on PCI
	help
	  Say Y here if you want the PCI core to produce a bunch of debug
	  messages to the system log.  Select this if you are having a
	  problem with PCI support and want to see more of what is going on.

	  When in doubt, say N.

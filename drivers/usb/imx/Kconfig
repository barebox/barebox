	  The Freescale i.MX SoCs have a variant of the chipidea ci13xxx for
	  USB support. Traditionally in barebox this is supported through the
	  EHCI driver for USB host and the ARC USB gadget driver for device.
	  This option instead enables support for i.MX chipidea support which
	  acts as a toplevel driver for the i.MX USB support. The chipidea
	  support also configures the usbmisc registers which traditionally
	  are configured in the board file.
	  This driver is recommended for new designs, but it needs board
	  support to work.
	  It's safe to say yes here. Also select EHCI support for USB host.

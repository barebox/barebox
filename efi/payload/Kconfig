	  Select this in order to include support for booting Linux
	  over the deprecated EFI handover protocol, which defines alternative
	  entry points into the EFI stub.

	  This is a practice that has no basis in the UEFI specification,
	  and requires a priori knowledge on the part of the bootloader about
	  Linux/x86 specific ways of passing the command line and initrd,
	  and where in memory those assets may be loaded.

	  This method of booting has been deprecated in Linux v6.2 in favor
	  of the StartImage() boot service and should not be required with
	  Linux v5.7 and above.

	  If you say y here, the handover protocol will be used, unless
	  global.linux.efi.handover=0 was set.

	  If unsure, keep the default of y. The StartImage support for booting
	  Linux is still new in barebox and will be made the default once we
	  gain more confidence in its implementation.

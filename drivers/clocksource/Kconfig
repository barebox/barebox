	help
	  When porting barebox to a new SoC there might be a case
	  of broken or absent clocksource. This causes barebox serial
	  console to be non functional.
	  To solve the problem this software-only clocksource driver is used.
	      WARNING!!! This clocksource doesn't provide correct timing.
	  To adjust this clocksource please use CONFIG_CLOCKSOURCE_DUMMY_RATE.
	  The bigger rate valuest makes clocksource "faster".
	  It's possible to add this clocksource unconditionally.
	  This clocksource starts very early (pure_initcall) so
	  real clocksource will take over.
	  This can help if initialization order is wrong so that
	  the time functions are used before the real clocksource
	  was initialized.
